For the data of the places, we created the [JSON API](https://spiritual-school-8644-data.onrender.com) to store the data.
Then we fetched the data from API and apply different filters and functionality.
We can filter our places based on our preference for the package and the duration of the tour of the place.
This was created by 👨‍💼 Aditya Choudhary.
